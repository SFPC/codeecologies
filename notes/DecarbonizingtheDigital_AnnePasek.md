Cloud computing has been publicized as having terrible environmental impact - due to work by Greenpeace.

Predominantly coal powered. Coal industry is propped up by tech industries. There isnt a grassroots answer on how to change this. Think about dropbox folder and things that you are never going to look at.

One way to think about this problem is to ask  how buildings are powered.

Large companies try to balance out the carbon by buying carbon offsets?

Buying renewable energy is weird because you cant be guaranteed to actually be using renweable energy sources on the grid. Renewable energy is also very uneven.

Potential to use the battery storage used as backup supply in cloud computing to connect to the grid.

If we can convince the cloud computing companies to connect to the grid, we risk reinforcing their monopolies.

One of the inherent challenges is of locality.

Green peace approaches this narrowly through the consumer side. Green Peace has a ranking system for these services.

Where does the organizing need to happen?

Cascades of benefits to pull people into coalition - such as the movement for energy democracy. Because we’ve privatised the energy grid, we don’t have as much of an ability to demand our government shuts down dirty energy plants.


3 visions for the future

Heterogenous place by place organizing where cloud companies are large players..

Nationalizing cloud servers.
A green new deal i.e. a massive public investment is needed to adequately address climate change. 

Globally, sites like NYT are using computational distribution networks (CDNs) throughout the world… how can those types of things be adressed?

Safari is clamping down on sites that use excessive bandwidth.

What are some design approaches the are more energy effeciant?

Spacial innequities - is more ethical to serve someone a highres image if the live in Oregan and use hydro rather than some in an area that uses more coal.

Are CDNs more or less hardful than sending data across the globe? Has it been studied that it is more environmentally to have more servers or to send things farther distances?

Cloud computing allows us to smooth out computing demand around the world? There are efficiencies with scaling…

A parrellel is in shipping - ocean shipping is hugely wasteful, but it means the environmnetal impact of shipping a single item is almost none.

Centralized vs decentralized - spatial innequities - nationalization has a completely different meaning in different places as well as completely different consequences. Is there a way for collective control to follow different borders than those exist currently…

Consensus is used to determine protocols online - is there a way to engage with those?

What is a model of power to talk to the people who actually make those decision?

Maybe we need a new regulatory body, like the EPA, but for technology? We don’t have a regulatory framework for these issues.

2 sad facts:
The only federal regulatory statute about cloud computing efficiency is only about federal comuting  and is financially focused.
In the case of microsoft their carbon neutral structure is meant to prepare them for future regulation and be resilient for risk - hopeful because the threat of legislation can cause change.

What are regulatory threats that a small town can do?

Where does divestment fit in to this? What can you do to avoid putting websites on AWS?

One of the spatial tensions is that there are still folks who will want their data close?

Maybe our bad habits can become useful, if we organize around them?

How much of these cloud computing businesses income comes from the Federal Government?

Pessimistic about individual responses to this, but what about a plug-in that would show web users the carbon mix for that server, or how much energy its consuming.

How do decentralized systems have more or less of an impact on things like this? What if the entire way we’re building web apps is completely inefficient? 

Is P2P possible through scale?

What is the difference between collectively run decentralisation and libertarian privatisation? How does privacy activism fit in to this?

The politics you broadcast has an interactive relationship with the technology you’re using to broadcast.

Its usefull to have an imagination for what could be and what the mechanics of organizing could be?

Are there even cloud computing solutions that are renewable energies based

Magazine called Low Tech that runs totally off renewables.
