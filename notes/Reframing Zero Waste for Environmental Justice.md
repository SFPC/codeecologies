**Reframing Zero Waste for Environmental Justice**

When proposed the talk, connection not clear to computing -- hoping that will come up.

Start off by trying to define environmental justice

Environmental racism: when there is an environmental harm, let’s say a toxic waste facility or waste infrastructure, it disproportionately impacts PoC and low income. On flip side, benefits disproportionately accessible to people who aren’t low income or PoC.

Environmental justice global movement started ~40, 50 years. Critical watershed moments: sanitation worker strike in Memphis, people noticing the toxic facilities and incinerators were always in black and brown, low income communities.

Environmental justice organizing in NYC. A few in the group are native New Yorkers -- mention that we send waste to Staten Island, New Jersey, several states on the mid-Atlantic. Ian’s waste station is in Red Hook and is newly renovated. All the trucks back up and dump everything into the middle of an O shaped building, bulldozers push it onto a boat, somehow ends up on a train.

In the 1950s, Fresh Kills landfill opens in Staten Island. All the trash would go there. In early 2000’s, Guiliani runs for mayor and his constituency was in Staten Island. He promises to close Fresh Kills to get elected. There was not a lot of communication with Dept of Sanitation, closed the landfill without a plan. Private waste transport firms pop up around the city, get contracted because there’s no landfill. They pop up where land is cheapest, intertwined with residential zones. Since then, 75% of NYC’s garbage is processed in three neighborhoods: South Bronx, North Brooklyn, Southeast Queens. A lot of environmental justice groups identify this as a problem—e.g. Environmental Justice Alliance. It’s fucked up that 75% of the trash goes to just these 3 places.

Just this year, after 15-20 years of organizing, a waste equity law was passed this year. Waste transfer stations in these three neighborhoods must take less trash. This tries to more equitably distribute where waste goes around the city.

Trash gets taken to landfills or waste to energy incinerators out of the city. Massive investments in marine transfer—there’s one for every borough—big push for borough equity where each borough takes care of their own trash. Waste gets taken there and gets taken on barges to other landfills and incinerators. It’s meant to be sustainable in that it’s a barge and not 50 trucks.

The reason Kathleen wants to have a conversation about zero-waste environmental justice is that the most compelling argument is that your waste contributes to this problem, but also doesn’t believe in individual burdens on what are collective and structural problems. Hopes to open up a discussion about waste in personal lives.

Nicholas asks: is there a correlation between class and amount of waste produced? Another participant answers: Amount is equitable, but types are very different. Example: food waste associated with certain locations, more toxins and plastic in lower income locations.

Johannah: In addressing this question, can connect to current event: the carbon tax in France, implemented then revoked. We want petroleum to be taxed, but it was a non-progressive tax. Question for Kathleen: how much does the Dept of Sanitation advocate with city government about environmental justice?

Kathleen says: DoS has worked closely with environmental justice advocates, but she doesn’t see the government as a harbinger of justice for the city. In terms of waste transfer siting, there has been good reform in the past few years—like you can’t put a station by a school. However, there are bigger unanswered questions.

Back to zero waste: when we think about it, we think about the image of the individual person not producing a lot of trash. White woman with little mason jar of all the trash she produced this year. Let’s reframe zero waste: why do we want it? In addition to the extractive practices, and protecting our oceans, we know who that waste will impact the most. Is it an upstream issue of regulating the industry? Contradiction of capitalism: why does NYC have private waste industry in charge of commercial waste, but also has zero waste as a goal. It has no incentive to decrease the amount of waste they haul.

Nate: Before today, I had never heard of zero waste. Interesting that this lifestyle was something that people of lesser means had always done—always used every material of every product they had. Things have reversed, and the throwaway culture is easier for people of lesser means. The thing about zero waste—we’re looking for governments to regulate the way people consume, which is a band-aid fix over things that have such momentum. There’s a decoupling of scientific ideas and social constructs—no matter how you handle waste, it’s material that needs to go somewhere.

Production needs to be stopped. There needs to be an environmental or natural resource tax on every product. In the UK, movement around the "circular economy." Pledge by industries to manage their own waste—looking at their own supply chain to reuse as much as possible. Contradiction between capitalism and conservation, but tries to look at zero waste as a business benefit. This is a public health issue. The rhetoric around sustainability in my neighborhood is such that in terms of individual choice, the environmental sustainability argument is not the most persuasive. You don’t see it in everyday life, and we’re in a stage of capitalism where consumption is perceived as wealth.

Just as it’s expensive to be poor, it’s expensive to consume sustainably. The incentives are misaligned for consumers.

on days that you travel more, do you waste more? Consensus from around the table is, absolutely. When communities are less transient, they waste less.

if you look at the lifecycle of a plastic fork and its impact, the real cost of a plastic fork should be about $15. But it’s only like $0.10. We’re in an artificially priced economy.

Book by Schumacher—economist who talked about incorporating the environmental impact into economic calculations. "Total cost model"

Conversation is gravitating back toward individual consumptions and individual actions. It may be that it feels impossible to thing about large scale system. Themes:

Production vs consumption

Regulation and cost incentives

Art as political practice—guy in LA who started building benches at bus stops as an art practice. This area could use interventions like that. What are possible artistic interventions we can make?

Oliver K. is an artist who uses trees as art interventions. Lived near highway in Canada, planted a tree as a public art project so they couldn’t build a highway bypass without taking it to court

What about getting grant money to pay people not to use plastic? A private subsidy to allow you not to have to participate in waste.

What if we could offer a way to make people’s lives easier instead of a financial incentive? People use what they use because it makes things easier and their lives are hard. How do we bring efficiency in lives and fix environmental issues at the same time?

Technology and regulation and consumption behavior move at different speeds. If better delivery mechanisms like driverless cars and distributed delivery come about, do we reduce containers by directly transporting goods and reducing trips to the store?

Amazon toilet paper delivered to the house is even more packaging than just going to the store. It’s cheap to put a box inside of a box with some bubble wrap for the box of toilet paper.

Brandless is a little bit better than Amazon. Everything is $3, they donate meals. Nothing is bubble wrapped or has extra plastic.

How do we make it cool not to consume things? Could we make community saving repositories?

to wrap up, think about these three categories

1. What interventions can we make?

2. Things we want to know more about—e.g. Industrial waste

3. Who are we holding accountable?—it’s not enough to hold consumers accountable. People's’ lives are pretty hard. What about people who profit from producing packaging? What industries, companies, etc?

Cultural shifts—some kids are taught to only drink water from bottles

Holding people accountable—Must consider scale and interaction of different pieces. if you have an extra efficient packaging company and sends things to your home, maybe they achieve efficiency by treating people badly in a warehouse. Simply by expanding the logistical reach of their business, maybe they use all the energy they saved. Thankfully, there are people realizing that all these issues are interrelated.

to add about the private waste industry, commercial waste is taken care of by private waste industry. It was run by the mafia. They are increasingly regulated and fighting to stay unregulated. Truck routes, contribute to NYC truck traffic problem. Issues: fake unions, minimum wage, an uncontracted employee was killed and it was covered up. It’s more dangerous than being a police officer. It’s not clear to me that when you have an unregulated terrible industry, that just behavioral shifts will be enough.

Just transitions for people currently working in private waste—it would be great if this industry shrank, but how can we think about the future for people who work in these industries, similarly to how we talk about coal miners?

For private waste companies who don’t even handle consumer waste, how do we hold them accountable?

E.g. a group called Transform Don’t Trash is trying to push for accountability. In waste management, there’s a transnational waste company that does work in New York. What does it look like to hold a massive transnational corporation like that accountable?

From climate change to climate justice—it’s hard to get people to make that jump. This is about other people’s lives, not just about making sure the mountain stays pretty. How do we communicate that?


## another set of notes
**Introductions**

### Discussion 

**When I proposed this breakout group, wasn’t sure what the relations were to computing, hope those can come up organically as we talk. What we know about environmental justice and environmental racism. We can start off by trying to define that and talk about what it is**

**Environmental racism is idea that when there is an environmental harm, toxic waste facility, it disproportionately impacts people of color and low income. Environmental benefits are disproportionately accessible to people who aren’t low income**

**Environmental justice global movement started about 40/50 years ago. A number of critical events… where people were noticing that these toxic facilities and incinerators were located…**

**Want to talk about environmental justice organizing in NYC, environmental waste.**

**Do you know where your waste goes?**

They used to ship it all to Staten Island and then NJ

Want to say that we have 7 states on the mid atlantic that we send them to…

Starts at home. Sanitation workers bring to waste transfer station, all trucks come, super cool building shaped like letter O, trucks dump stuff into middle, on the floor, all these bulldozers and they dump it onto a boat and then train

**Where is it?**

Fort Hamilton parkway, in Red Hook

**Why the landscape of waste infra look show it does in NYC. 1950s fresh kill landfill opened on Staten Island, that would be where all the waste goes. When Guiliani running for mayor, constituency was in staten island, promised them to close fresh kill to get elected. Not a lot of comm with dep of sanitation, shitty system, landfill closed without plan. Bunch of waste transfer stations popped up, city would contract them. Private waste transfer stations would open in manufacturing zones intertwined with residential zones. These tend to be sited where land is the cheapest. Since then 75% of NYC’s garbage is processed in three neighborhoods, south bronx, north brooklyn, southeast queens. A lot of environmental justice groups in NYC identify this as problem, like NYC environmental justice alliance. Were saying that fucked up that 75% of trash is going to these communities. Main reform that came out of that happened this year, after 15-20 years of organizing around this. Waste equity law passed around this. Waste transfer stations had to take less trash to more economically distribute how waste goes around the city. What Ian is saying about how this waste is transferred, DSNY truck picks up trash, then goes to waste transfer station, then landfills and waste energy incinerators outside NYC. city has done massive infra investments to marine transfer stations (1 for every borough). Borough equity, each borough takes care of its own garbage. These are massive waste bits, taken away on barges to other landfills and incinerators. Meant to be a lot more sustainable in the sense that it isn’t 50 trucks driving through manhattan. That brings us up to speed to where we are now. Reason I want to have convo around zero waste environmental justice, one of most compelling reasons is that your waste is going to contribute to this problem. At same time, individual actions to what should be collective and structural problems. Would like to open floor for more discussion. Share some thoughts on how you feel about waste in your personal life.**

Question: is there any correlation between classes and the waste?

There’s been a number of studies and it’s surprisingly… the types of waste is very different. It usually broken down.. Food waste is predominantly associated with certain locations and cultures. Tend to be more toxins in lower-income neighborhood waste, more plastic depending on the zip code.

That’s interesting. Reason I ask is bc we talked about collective action vs individual action and I wanted to... I’‘m new to this space and know that couple people have challenged your [Ian’s] approach

And addressing that question, there is current event which is carbon tax. There needs to be some diesel should be taxed, but perceived that this was progressive tax. How do you establish economic equity amongst it in terms of enviromental justice? How much advocacy does the department of sanitation involve themselves in enviro justice?

**Personally don’t think the government... I think the dep of sanitation has worked closely with environmental justice advocates to make what they’re pushing for happen, but don’t see the gov as harbinger of justice for the city**

Do you have hope that it could be or just despair?

**I think that some of the in terms of waste transfer siting, have been a lot of reforms on waste transfer locations, can’t be placed next to schools. Those questions come down to siting issues that are bigger than dep of sanitation and are a little too big for me to think about what needs to be done there. When we think of zero waste now, think about that image of individual image that hasn’t produced a lot of waste, mason jar image. My q is if we can reframe zero waste where we’re saying why do we want zero waste? In addition to extractive practices and fossil fuels and protecting our oceans, we know what that’s impacting the most. Reframe if upstreaming that … doesn’t make sense that NYC would have private waste industry and would be in charge of commercial waste industry. Private has no incentive to decrease amount of waste. **

Industries that produce organic material, have to come cart organics away, quantity of companies doing that compost is countable. Despite fact that there’s new law, no one’s doing it. We want to make industrial and private waste less, but not move forward

Before today, never heard of concept of zero waste, interesting to me that this is a reaction that have been built up over years. That lifestyle is always used by people of lower means. Over time, things are reversed, the throwaway culture is pervasive for people of lesser means. One of things about zero waste these kinds of ideas or looking for gov to regulate how people consume is mainly more such a bandaid fix for something with so much momentum. Decoupling of science and social construct. These materials go somewhere, how do we change manufacturing to change behavior instead of individuals?

Production needs to be stopped and taxed. Needs to be enviro tax. corps pay for garbage, huge cost, but there needs to be some kind of natural resource taxed on every... that’s developed. In UK a lot of movement around circular economy, kind quite far ahead

**Can you define circular economy?**

That there’s right now it’s pledged by various industries to manage their own waste effectively. Actually looking at own supply, their own supply chain and trying to reuse as much as possible. Always going to be contradiction between capitalism and conservation of resources. System that looks at zero waste as a business benefit.

Can we talk more about that?

Also think I live in low income neighborhood that’s in transition. Very much a public health issue. Rhetoric around how we talk about sustainability in my community with some of my neighbors that they care about the environment but in terms of individual choice, environmental sustainability argument is less persuasive one

You hardly see it, you’re the scenario of trying to get by day by day

Consumption is perceived as wealth by some

Not disagreeing but there’s kind of sense that it’s expensive to be efficient in the same way that

people talk about how it’s expensive to be green. Not easy to find a place that will sell you something without packaging, you’re not consumer demographic that system is catering to. It’s hard to market it in a consumer sense, bc people you are trying to appeal to is not everyone

I spent a lot more 

So much yogurt, brands that sell container that you can take part, but cost of that vs 

Most yogurt containers are recyclable,  cool but still plastic my whole thing is trying to live zero waste, but still recycling. Trying to cut it down.

Another q: have you noticed on days that you travel more that easier for you to waste more. Transient kind of ?

Airports

Talking about waste streams how NY moves its waste elsewhere, we’ve lost sense of community, when communities less transient, they waste less

But we’re living in completely artificial economy. Actual cost of plastic fork should be $15. If you look at lifecycle and impact on environmental. Right now non-reusable utensil is 10 cents and the reusable one is 10 x that

Book by e f schumacher, was an economist in the 70s, popularized this idea of sustanability, incorporating impact of environment into economic calculations.

It’s a total cost model.

**I noticed that convo is gravitating back towards individual items and actions, one reason for that feel so impossible to think about zero waste beyond that. Huge massive systems, it’s a lot easier to think about what we can control within our lives. Themes: production vs consumption, different things that need to happen on each end. Regulation and cost incentives.**

One other thing I’ve seen very interesting art projects that this area if ripe for, guy in LA started building benches. No benches at bus stops in this one neighborhood in LA. made that his art practice. Made profound effects on travel and communication. If we could talk about possible interventions

Artist Oliver K dos a lot of trees as art interventions. Lives somewhere in canada, gov wanted to build highway bypass, got grant money to plant a tree, couldn’t do that. Legal framework artist used to put a plant somewhere is very interesting.

Interesting to get grant money to get people to pay people for plastics. Like to go around neighborhood and say pay you not to use plastic. Give you private subsidy to allow you to not have to do this

**Think about this a lot. If people had financial incentive, people would do things differently. Could be financial incentive, but also offer a way to make lives easier? People revert to using what they use bc it makes their lives easy bc their lives are hard. How can we think about bringing more efficiency to people’s lives and fixing environment at same time**

Thinking about tech and regulation and consumption behavior and how those thigns can meet, move at different speeds, be at odds, if any kind of delivery mechanism, do we kill habit of people going to store and consuming. Instead of milk delivery, moving products themselves. If you go places, inherently have some package or containers…

Flip side, don’t know how many people get amazon toilet paper delivered to their house.. You’re right, amazing potential to eliminate it. But really cheap to put box in box with bubble wrap

Do you know about brandless, one of better ones (explanation about what brandless is) everything is $3, and they also donate meals to hungry families, not sure how it’s actually helping the families, but nothing is bubble wrapped, nothing has extra plastic

How do we make it cool not to consume things. What happens when you don’t have enough money and how hard it is to save. Possible to set up community saving repositories, people could borrow money, could be its own economy, by not spending money could contribute to this and build some wealth for yourself.

**Frame concluding part, 3 buckets, 1. intervention, 2. things we want to know more about**

**Talked about industrial waste earlier but who is producing it, how, where does it go**

**3. Who are we holding accountable, third bucket**

**"People’s lives are pretty hard, you don’t have any money right now, but you have to recycle."**

**Who do we hold accountable, people who produce packaging, what industries**

I hold apple accountable. They don’t allow you to repair the products

Also things like water, there’s no need for water bottles or water to be sold in the store

But also cultural. Have some students that say mom says we drink out of water bottles. Hard to cultural shift.

Any package designers here?

To who we hold accountable, the larger the scale, the larger we blow that up to political authorities, the more difficult it is to propose solution but easier to resolve tensions when we think about things culturally. If you have extra efficient packaging company that packages things well, still all these issues where they’re achieving efficiency by exploiting people horribly in a warehouse, or simply expanding logistical reach of business. Spending all energy saved elsewhere onto packaging. To address how all those pieces interact… silver lining of political situation is that people are realizing these problems are all interrelated...easier to conceptualize that you participating in one part of the problem contributes to other part of problem that you won’t have to deal with.

**On accountability, all residential waste in NYC is taken care of DSNY. all commercial waste is taken by private waste industry. That was controlled by mafia, they are only now starting to be more regulated, fighting tooth and nail to be free market unregulated hell they currently are. A lot of different issues, every private waste company contracts with individual restaurant, trucks routes go all over the city, contribute to traffic jobs. Really shitty, fake unionized, minimum wage. Recent incident one employee was killed on job and they covered it up. Sanitation jobs are more dangerous than being a police officer. It’s not clear to me when you have such unregulated and terrible industry that behavioral shifts are going to be enough. Need private waste industry transition for jobs that exist there.**
