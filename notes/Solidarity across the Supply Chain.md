# Solidarity Across the Supply Chain
*Facilitators: Ingrid Burrington, Jamie Tyberg*

Discussion Objective:

**The expectation that social struggles have obvious solutions in systems that already exist is flawed. And struggles get siloed and separated from each other.**

Ingrid => environmental history of SV.

Landscape literally filled with toxic waste. Found in the ground water of MV, PA, SJ due to historical presence of chip manufacture in 1970’s and 80’s.

Mostly immigrant, mostly female employees, exposed to toxic materials.

Sourced in the aversion to landscape aesthetics impacted by above ground storage. (Terrible consequences: leaked into ground water aquifers; physical health due to exposure)

"Silicon Valley of Dreams" (2002)

"My first job: Reflections on contemporary capitalism"

NOT ARCHIVED/ CATEGORIZED AS COMPUTING HISTORY (CA, Environmental history, industrial manufacture history)

No political consciousness; no connection between people involved (tech workers) and their consequences.

**Where can organizing power be placed in this larger system?**

**Where can we effectively draw connections? **

Jamie => Why this breakout session?

* if you don’t have a grand narrative, it’s hard to organize

    * Lack of alignment and incentive structures(scope, scale, community), phrased as "togetherness"

    * Divisiveness amongst groups that could work together

* Global North: conversation around tech revolves around individual impact (surveillance, privacy, etc.) vs asymmetric impact of oppressed peoples

* What are examples of "solidarity across the supply chain?"

    * Based in experiences around Paris Climate Talks and the lack of inclusive representation there (particularly among youth representatives)

    * Americans have a myopic perspective

        * How can we develop and prioritize jeopardies?

        * And how can we act on this understanding?

* How can we effectively navigate the micro and macro?	

    * What are the problems with applying cybernetic thinking to everything?

    * How can we operate with multiple frameworks simultaneously? (Because thinking in systems is inherently *difficult!)*

    * *"The tyranny of structure-less-ness"*

* Are there tools from organizing that provide both individual fulfillment and collective empowerment?

Ingrid: Anxiety surrounding "trying to see everything at once"

Supply chains are not designed to be seen, and they’re not designed to be transparent.

They’re designed to be efficient.

It’s not simply a matter of being able to see all of the parts. (That’s a misunderstanding of what they do and how systems of power react to being asked to show themselves.)

There’s a difference b/t understanding connections of many things vs. capturing everything simultaneously.

* Is climate change a question of moral value? Is it a problem of not having enough organization?

**(It’s a bit tough to hear; will you paraphrase?)**

How does the solidarity economy relate to what we’ve been talking about today, in terms of the relationship between ecology and technology.

BDS(?) (Boycott Divestments and Sanctions) Movement as an example of solidarity in action?

→ Have you ever been in a different, less extractive position?

→ Examples of conscious connection to production?

"I’m a software engineer and don’t believe I produce anything of value."

* How can we get closer to supply chains and understand where our Things come from?

* Purposeful separation of production; how can we get closer to that?

* Not buying particular products (consumer activism)

We’re in this system rather we like it or not. And while we can ask "What can we do as individuals?" we should question and challenge why we’re even in the position that we’re in. Why are we limited to only being consumers?

Impact of US military is not trivial; largest polluters, maintainers of superstructures

What can we do as Americans living at the center of the empire?

* Most efficient response is to expose the military for what it is, and sharing this understanding with other Americans.

* The military does not fulfill its purported service of protection (quite the opposite)

* We should understand how we benefit off the persecution and oppression of others.

Distinction between personal responsibility in solidarity and collective organizing?

Ex. Google employees organizing against Project Maven *at Google*...How do we make sure the entire scheme does not happen and does not exist.

"I’m doing this not because I feel bad that *my* code will be used to kill people, but because *code should not be used to kill people.*"

(Went to Amazon...Tech Workers Coalition Slack channel)

Positing a redefinition of "sustainability" and holding time as another vector?

Perspective from project in gulf coast oil industry: everyone worked in the oil industry & were the first to feel their effects: cross-supply chain, trans-generational

Parallel in military: pay for education and shared family involvement

One of the best things we can do for solidarity is a replacement energy economy, and make sure people don’t have to go to the military so they can go to school

Jamie: Ya Ya Network

Youth Allies Youth Activism

Ban military recruitment

Difficulties scaling cooperatives and collections

→ Worker owned cooperative models of business structures functioning at scale

→ Listen to Doug Rushkoff’s interview with Natahan Schneider on the Team Human podcast for a history of cooperatives in the US--robust and valid business structure!

→ "Everything for Everyone"

→ "Click Here to Kill Everybody"

Military investment in renewable energy?

Dynamics of sprawling military contracting?

Religious model (from cybernetics) of persisting and winning because "there’s no other option"

"Expectation of wins" and “The Grand Narrative” of history as problematic framework of understanding

Finding solidarity at scale by operating through our own individual constraints

Fragile nature of systems based on cybernetics
