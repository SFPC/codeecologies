# Sustainable energy, and creative and educational application of solar power

*Facilitator: Alex Nathanson*

(these notes started halfway through the session)

default battery chargers are AC
inverting to 120 and then converting back to DC
Trickle Charging — safe way to not explode a battery

  charging it 0.1% of it’s capacity 
  some camping items are geared towards 12V
  opens up the option to run things on DC power
  this would cut out the deficiencies in inversion from DC to AC to DC

Anne — interested in energy being an aesthetic problem
light turning on is important ideological event
how do you make visible the aesthetic the relations of power?

transition to cleaner climate:

  how to make it seamless?
  is there a way to make aesthetic choices and using education to influence energy choices

how much is the sustainability energy story not really sustainable?
should we just be using less?

people will always be heating their houses
we need a way to more sustainably achieve these things

how to see the connection between companies and energy consumption

the question of let’s all use less energy falls inequality on peoples shoulders
as the climate warms air conditioning becomes more about a necessity 
the bulk of emissions comes from the 1% (in the form of air travel), so as a place to do some cutting down on emissions that’s where it should be cut down on

there’s a lot of investment in China in long distance DC transmission lines 
when we built out our grid in the US we used AC because the cost of sending DC energy was too high
in reality there’s a point where DC over long distance at higher voltage becomes more efficient

Cost of solar power:

  economies of scale play a huge role in bringing down the cost of solar power
  residential roof $0.30 a lot, down from $80 a lot in the 1970s
    due to economies of scale — as we do more of this work there is more money in the system, so more work in this field reduces the cost of solar panels
  interconnection agreement — no batteries, so if the grid goes down you don’t have power
  selling back to the grid → 1 to 1 ratio, what you give back is equal to what you get back
  separate section → you have a separate agreement that determines what the power is, which is priced by time of day or year, etc.
  systems typically get paid off in 10-20 years
  complex economic models influence how one gets funding
