# Computing, climate change, and police and prison abolition

*Facilitator: Nabil Hassein*

## Introductions/Group motivations & interest in this topic:

* I want to bring disjointed things together

* Climate change is a racist crisis affecting people w/o the means to deal with it

* Relationship between landfills and prisons

* what can libraries do for prison abolition

* data, surveillance, the environment

* Defy ventures

* how to contribute to the movement

* sustainability & buildings, runoff, resource-consumption; we’re not building for the future

* learn about climate change and tech

* systems of control & power

* bringing generative/productive energy around prison abolition 

* want to figure out own role w/r/t how fucked up prisons are; can be paralyzing; relationship w climate change: prisoners fighting forest fires

* incarceration is a structural, integrated part of this empire

* numbers, accounting, computing are all relational 

## Discussion

* Anger & its relevance to social & political organizing: sometimes depression/anger mean I don’t take a particular action

    * History: After shut down rikers, a lot of anger around how the work toward prison abolition could be turned around 

    * Che Guevera: If you tremble at every indignation then you’re a comrade of mine

    * It’s about recognizing the need to change our relationships

* Centrality of jails to US history

* Taeyoon opened the event with a land acknowledgement

    * 500 years ago, on this land, there were no prisons at all

    * prisons are a historically recent invention & in 300 years (maybe) there will not be again

    * What about dungeons?

        * racism and prisons are completely intertwined

        * Indigenous, african, systems looked completely different

        * Hunting, patrolling, surveilling, jailing, did not exist

* Timelines? For example, licensing laws changed in 1982, allowing the tech industry to grow, changed things really quickly; timeline in the context of a human life (only 80 years)

* What are people’s thoughts around Trump’s prison reform? Versus for example abolishing bail in CA?

* Climate change refugees being imprisoned & this is being normalized; this machine is so well ingrained 

* The temporal condition; relationship to land was different, the concept of the state didn’t exist

* Golden Gulag: CA prison system book: you need to understand water politics in CA, to understand all the incentives that interlock to create the prison system

* What do we want to do with this land instead? What are spatial approaches to imagining…?

* No new jails: we are an abolitionist group but other people don’t want jails for different reasons

    * Jail Free NYC (slogan): maybe people can understand this in their local context

    * Maybe there shouldn’t be a cop in the school

    * 5000 cops in NYC schools, double the number of counselors; 

    * Borders between the global north & south are being redefined now

* Non reformist versus reformist reforms:

    * Non reformist: it is a reform that brings us to the horizon of abolishing prisons

    * Reformist: humane jails; they would be built & be there 

    * Environmental harms around landfills & jails; rural areas sea land (& thus landfills & prisons) as a way to profit

* The role private companies are playing is surveilling migrants; what are the relationships between governments & data brokers

* E-carceration: not physically in jail but tracked

* Rikers was a reformist jail, applauded by social workers when unveilled

* What would the condos on Riker’s look like? In 100 years?

* What’s working?

    * Looking at the patchwork & network of prisons; it’s CA, the federal government, etc. Is it easier to intervene in the interplay of these smaller systems.

* Gentrification is another border that’s just being moved; a ton of small situations that could be addressed on the ground

* You can see the difference in where police stand, in Crown Heights, over the past 5 years; it’s always a spatial thing, whether it’s with a block or international borders

* Abolition & anti-imperialism are closely linked: everything has a class character (ty Marx) the tech that the US govt & indigenous groups use are different

* I think I support the abolishment of borders, but who would go first? Some borders exist for oppressed nations to protect themselves from imperialism

* 100 years ago, borders & customs didn’t exist how they exist now

* Re: calling 311 on homeless people when the weather gets cold; is this going to happen now with heat waves?

* Reporting/enlisting residents to survey where homeless people on the block

* Why do we need 7 cops to respond to one homeless person?

* Australian context: trying not to homeless counted in the census?

* What happened to homeless carts? (Name?)

    * Public art project/manifesto: it fell short of addressing actual needs that addressed more what the artist needed than what the community needed

    * It’s a good art/design example & not a good social justice example

    * As an artist you have to ask, is this for my imagination?

    * It usually helps to talk to the people you’re trying to make something for

* There’s not emotional infrastructure in y/our life to deal with the overwhelming anger/frustration, around the end of the world, global capitalism, prisons: Do you feel like you have a space to send all of this?

* Letter writing project (please find reference!) helps fill this emotional space

* Individual-focused discussion is problematic when we need transformative/institutional change

* Let’s have a group around climate grief

* Boxing or other martial arts can help express emotion physically

* Realizing your job is pointless and stupid can be a great motivating force
