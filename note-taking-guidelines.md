## High level objectives for Code Ecologies public notes
- Summarize the breakout discussions, particularly resources and next steps, for the benefit of those who could not attend.
- Publish all notes to the notes folder of this public repository the same day as the event, December 15th.
- Use a common format for all notes documents, described in detail below.
- Err on the side of respecting the privacy of participants who do not want their comments attributed to them.
- Without compromising the above, attempt to name participants who do want credit for their words.

## Technical Details
### Format of notes
If you're comfortable with it, use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) as the common format for all notes documents.
This is a lightweight plain-text format that is easily converted to other formats such as HTML or PDF.

If you are not familiar with markdown, create a google doc and send it to the organizers via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AZFoMLveMf5FUw43OKgmjKF-E1HSB3BxLhR4l-aVpGo/edit).

To the extent you are able, please try to give the notes a little bit of structure with headings, list items, etc.

### Naming notes documents
Please give your file a name that looks like `name-of-breakout.md` if it has an official name.
If there is no official session name, use your judgment to describe the theme of the discussion, perhaps asking other participants for their ideas regarding short summary description!

### Uploading documents to this repository
If you are comfortable with a [github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/), adding your notes to this repository in that way minimizes work for us.
If not, share the link to a google doc of notes with the organizers via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AZFoMLveMf5FUw43OKgmjKF-E1HSB3BxLhR4l-aVpGo/edit).

## Substantive notes
### What to capture
Try to repeat the speaker's words rather than rephrasing your interpretation of their meaning.
However, of course it will be impossible for most people to create a transcript of an unplanned real-time discussion.
Do your best to summarize the key points that participants in the discussion are making.

### Privacy
By default, avoid naming who said what, unless the participant indicates that they do want to be named/credited for a particular comment.
If possible, at the beginning of the session when folks introduce themselves, prompt them to say a word about whether they affirmatively do want to be credited for their contributions to the discussion.
Even for people who are comfortable with their name being published, use your judgment to leave out highly personal details that belong in the room and not on the public internet.

As a note-taker, prioritize respecting privacy first, and capturing as much insight as possible in the limited time second, over writing down speakers' names.
