## High level objectives for Code Ecologies public notes
- Summarize the breakout discussions, particularly resources and next steps, for the benefit of those who could not attend.
- Publish all notes to the notes folder of this public repository the same day as the event, December 15th.
- Use a common format for all notes documents, described in detail below.
- Err on the side of respecting the privacy of participants who do not want their comments attributed to them.
- Without compromising the above, attempt to name participants who do want credit for their words.

## Technical Details
### Format of notes
If you're comfortable with it, use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) as the common format for all notes documents.
This is a lightweight plain-text format that is easily converted to other formats such as HTML or PDF.

If you are not familiar with markdown, create a google doc and email it to nabil via nabil.hassein@gmail.com.

To the extent you are able, please try to give the notes a little bit of structure with headers, list etc.

### Naming notes documents
Please give your file a name that looks like `name-of-breakout.md` if it has an official name.
If there is no official session name, use your judgment to describe the theme of the discussion.

### Uploading documents to this repository
If you are comfortable with a [github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/), that is the easiest way for us.
If not, share the markdown file or google doc directly with Nabil via email via nabil.hassein@gmail.com.

## Substantive notes
### What to capture
Try to repeat the speaker's words rather than rephrasing your interpretation of their meaning.
However, it will be impossible for most people to create a transcript of an unplanned real-time discussion.
Do your best to summarize the key points that participants in the discussion are making.

### Privacy
We will provide some lightweight system, such as stickers for attendees to wear, indicating whether or not they want their comments attributed to them.
This should be considered as that person's default -- please listen also for folks saying they do or do not want to be named for a particular comment.
Even for people who are comfortable with their name being published, leave out highly personal details that belong in the room and not on the public internet.

As a note-taker, prioritize respecting privacy first, and capturing as much insight as possible in the limited time second, over writing down speakers' names.
