# Code Ecologies

This repository has organizing material for the [Code Ecologies](http://sfpc.io/codeecologies/) forum, to be held on December 15, 2018 at the School for Poetic Computation, 155 Bank St, New York. 

After the event, this repository will also hold text documentation, such as the notes taken by our volunteers during the break-out sessions.

Tasks will be tracked on the [project board](https://github.com/SFPC/codeecologies/projects/1).
